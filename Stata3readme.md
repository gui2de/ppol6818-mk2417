# README: Sampling Noise in a Fixed Population

## Objective

This assignment explores how sampling noise affects regression estimates when drawing samples from a fixed population. We simulate repeated sampling and regression at different sample sizes (N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000), and examine how estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals behave.
